# __The FullStack LA Local Meetup Map Page__

### What is it good for?

This is a hub for information about LA Meetups so that people can see what's up, learn and get involved. It's also a place where organizers might collaborate, but that's *waaay* in the future. Right now, it's a map.

### How are we doing it?

We will be scrumming this project. __Scrum__ is an __Agile__ framework, one of a series of dove-tailing practices derrived from on-the-job experience in development to make the creation process collaborative, organized, iterative, changeable, and overall fun. Another important Agile methodology we use is __Extreme Programming.__

- Blog post introducing Scrum to come... watch this space.

Inside the Scrum framework, we will be using __Pair Programming__, a practice of Extreme Programming where there are two developers working together on a single issue with a single computer. Pair Programming is great fun, produces results faster than two individual developers working on two seperate issues, and is a high-powered way to learn more about software development.

<a href="http://developingian.com/pairing-on-a-map-page/">Here is a blog article</a> explaining the story of the meetup map page's development, and an experience of pair programming so you can get a taste of what it is like if you are new to it.

### How's it put together?

The page is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the front-end, this triad of languages is what you need to have a page. Sure, you can have a page with just HTML, but it's boring and ugly.
- __HTML__ - The Bones
- __CSS__ - The Skin
- __JavaScript__ - The Muscle

The JavaScript is imbedded in index.html along with some map-specific CSS.
It is forked from a GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/maptimeLA/git_your_map_here">MaptimeLA</a>

The index.html file also carries links to the style.css and any other resources, such as map tiles, and geoJSON data for pointing out the locations of the meetups.

__GeoJSON__ is just a JSON file with lattitude and longitude values. 
__JSON__ is a data format that is created out of JavaScript Objects; associated key:value pairs from which our JavaScript map program (embedded in the index.html file) gets data to display on our page. Our geoJSON file is found in the data folder.

### What needs to be done next?
